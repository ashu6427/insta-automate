# insta-automate
Instagram Automation using Python
First you need to have python installed in your system and selenium webdriver (go to cmd->type "pip install selenium")
Then we need driver for carrying out the operations. For this you can use any driver I have used chromedriver, you can use as per you're preference.
Keep chromedriver.exe & insta.py in same folder.
